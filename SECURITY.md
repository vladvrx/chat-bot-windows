# Security notes

This is a small-club reconstruction, not a supported production distribution.
Do not reuse real credentials or sensitive accounts while experimenting with it.

Reconstructed packages default the official updater, Sentry, and upstream
telemetry off at the Electron-main packaging boundary. The bootstrap download
and hydrated `app.asar` are checksum-pinned.

Windows output is a portable, unsigned directory. Packaging removes the
upstream executable certificate before applying the reconstructed product
identity. Windows may therefore display an unrecognized-app warning. Do not
work around that warning for a build whose hashes and provenance you have not
checked yourself.

`npm audit` still reports compatibility-bound advisories in the pinned Electron
42.1 runtime, Undici 5 / Connect 1 stack, AI SDK 4, and OpenTelemetry stack.
Patch-level fixes are applied where they do not change reconstructed runtime
contracts. The remaining major upgrades are intentionally tracked as follow-up
work rather than silently changing application behavior during publication
cleanup.

Please report issues privately to the repository owner rather than opening a
public disclosure against this experimental codebase.
