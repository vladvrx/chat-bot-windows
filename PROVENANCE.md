# Provenance

The reconstruction is based on the public macOS arm64 and Windows x64 release
artifacts. The macOS identity is:

- Product: Grok Bot
- Version: 0.18.0
- Upstream bundle ID: `com.anysphere.sand`
- Electron framework: 42.1.0
- DMG URL: `https://downloads.cursor.com/grokbot/stable/darwin-arm64/0.18.0/Grok_Bot_0.18.0.dmg`
- DMG SHA-256: `a253ccd8aab01e083f9812a0264354c5034d8ba7f0610bbb557e82ae77d203eb`
- Original `app.asar` SHA-256: `6665408168466f9cacc6087e917890c17f59d2e2e9c2404a5c4a59ad79c1de58`

The repository preserves the original macOS artifact above and the matching
Windows x64 installer through Git LFS. The Windows artifact identity is:

- Installer URL: `https://downloads.cursor.com/grokbot/stable/win32-x64/0.18.0/Grok_Bot_0.18.0_Setup.exe`
- Installer SHA-256: `464079a15ef5fa8b61ccea8fffcc78f63cfcf6df65fb0ad5e725d8b95f7e437e`
- Original Windows `app.asar` SHA-256: `38e85c0e5042c0257db7925e1e55709d6d155d90d92fe26ad654127d509766e0`
- Original Windows shell SHA-256: `86719c9dcbfc580b7bc29ece62302401a7622ae577e2cff42b4c525db674f1ca`
- Preservation manifest: `research-archives/original/0.18.0/artifacts.json`

The original macOS application was Developer ID signed and notarized by
Anysphere Incorporated. Reconstructed macOS builds use a different bundle ID
and an ad-hoc signature. Reconstructed Windows builds remove the original
Authenticode certificate payload and replace the executable version identity.
Neither package retains or claims the upstream signature.

The shipped renderer contained optimized production bundles, not the authored
frontend source or source maps. The readable `frontend/` tree is therefore a
partial evidence-backed reconstruction, while packaged builds retain the pinned
renderer and apply only a narrow, hash-recorded settings transform.

No upstream source-code license is implied. Do not present reconstructed
material as original source or an official build, and complete an independent
rights review before public redistribution.

## Evidence-only reconstruction rule

The immutable release is the product specification. Recovered source may express
only behavior supported by at least one inspectable artifact anchor: emitted code
or source-path markers, extracted capsules/source maps, shipped strings/assets/CSS,
renderer DOM signatures, IPC/RPC contracts, or repeatable observation of the
shipped runtime.

This rule is especially strict for the renderer. Do not invent or redesign a
screen, route, control, label, selector, state, or interaction to fill an evidence
gap. A clean abstraction or test seam is acceptable only when it preserves
artifact-derived semantics and does not add product behavior. When evidence is
incomplete, record the uncertainty and leave the feature unmapped or
evidence-only instead of guessing.

Every UI-facing recovery must identify its artifact anchor in its evidence
catalog, focused test, or coverage note. Passing typecheck/build alone is not
proof of provenance; speculative behavior is a release-blocking defect.
